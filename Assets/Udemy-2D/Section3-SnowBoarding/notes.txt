This is not code related but I wanted to make a note in this section about the Sprite Profiler, Cinemachine (and I think there was one other thing...)
Sprite Profiler - Sprite Profiler is the thing that we used to create the slope and it used Vector/Bel points points to round off the edges.  
  You can also add as much as you want.  Also, to get the snow to look more, that was done by following these steps.
  1) Select the profiler
  2) Select edit points
  3) Select all points
  4) Change the height

  -Another note about Sprite Profiler is that you need a edge collider

Surface Effector - This is how we are making the snowboarder move without gravity completely stopping him.

Cinemachine - This is how we are making the follow player, and its simple.  Just need to make note of it, and we can make a bunch of Virtual cameras or
  camera rules for the main (and possibly other) cameras.  This is incase we want one rule to zoom in on powerup or ect.
