# Unity2D-VSAndDemo
 
All is welcome! This is going to a repo for me to test different types of 2D gameplay as demos or Vertical Slices

## This is for educational use

I will post all educational materials I used to create these Demos and VS.  This is for the following reasons:
1. To give credit is where credit is due
2. If it is a independent creator on Udemy, YouTube, and ect it is to give shoutouts and support to these people.

This is for educational use, so forks, pulls, and anything else welcome!
